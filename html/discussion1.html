            <h1>Adobe Fresco vs Procreate</h1>
            <p>Hey everyone. I just recently got an iPad Mini 6 and bought myself a digital pen. I've been looking at both Fresco and Procreate and can't decide which one to go with. I know Procreate is a one time purchase and to unlock all of Fresco is a monthly sub. Just wanted to get everyone's opinions on both programs. Thanks in advance ☺️</p>

        <textarea>What are your thoughts?</textarea>
        <div>
            <p>I haven't used Fresco so this will be pointless, but Procreate is fantastic.

                If you're using a mini iPad the minimalistic UI of Procreate might be a big plus too.</p>
            <p>I use both programs, the big difference is one is raster and one is vector. So since fresco is vector I'll use it for t shirt designs and things that need scaling and to retain their details.<br>

                Procreate I use for my illustration work and I like to work at first traditionally in watercolor/ink and then scan my work and edit/add elements in procreate.<br>Procreate is also amazing for commissions and figuring out details with clients and use it for the planning stages of my pet portraits since I can easy move elements around and change it up based on client feed back. Basically creating my own reference/blue print to then go create my painting in real life on canvas.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your reply! Perhaps I will have both programs as I do both!</p>
            <p>Doesn't fresco have a free version? If so - try it out! Imo, the only appealing feature is the live brushes... Which only works on small canvases since the brushes doesn't work when they're larger. The maximum brush size is 500px iirc.<br>

                I haven't used procreate but I would still go with that. It looks like a very good and cheap app. Fresco is not ''there' yet in my eyes. It only has the bare minimum of features and there aren't a lot you can customize yourself.</p>
