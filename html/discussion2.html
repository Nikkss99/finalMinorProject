            <h1>Where to host a 3D location/background?</h1>
            <p>Hello! I often like to role-play murder mystery games with my friends, and I've been wanting to host my own game, with a location modeled in 3D.<br>
                That's not a problem, but I don't know how I'd show it to them, I'd like for them to be able to explore or "walk" around the 3D environment without me needing to stream it to them, or without them having to install Maya, Blender, or any other app.<br>
                I'd like for it to be a bit more organic, like when you click on Google Map's street view.<br>
                Does anyone know of any site that could allow something like this? Or what I should do if there's none?</p>
