            <h1>Does anyone know where I can find free drawing references/poses?</h1>
            <p>Ik you get some on pinterest, but I don't feel comfortable using them anymore. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>for poses? deviantART. look up adorkastock, jookpubstock, null-entity, theposearchives, etc. look thru who they collab with & who gets recommended on the sidebar when you look at their stock as well. good luck!</p>
            <p>https://line-of-action.com/en/ Is a good one.</p>
            <p>Pixabay is good</p>
            <p>Taking them yourself, even better making videos of yourself in the pose.<br>

                Deviantart pose stock is really great, but you see different people drawing the same poses and realise the pool isn't that large.<br>
                
                If you're just aiming to learn, deviantart is soo good. But if you're going pro then taking your own reference will help you stand out. I would really recommend it</p>
